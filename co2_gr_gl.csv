# Annual CO2 mole fraction increase (ppm) from Jan 1 through Dec 31.
#
# The uncertainty in the global annual mean growth rate is estimated using a
# monte carlo technique that computes 200 time series of global annual growth
# rates, each time using measurement records from a different sampling of sites
# from the NOAA GML cooperative air sampling network.  Each year has a different
# uncertainty.  Please see Conway et al., 1994, JGR, vol. 99, no. D11. for a
# complete discussion.  The last one or two years listed could have preliminary
# uncertainties set equal to the average uncertainty since 1980.
# Before 1980 the global growth rate has been approximated by taking the average
# of Mauna Loa and the South Pole, correcting for the offset between (MLO+SPO)/2
# and the global Marine Boundary Layer, as described in Ballantyne et al, 2012
#
# CO2 expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol, abbreviated as ppm
#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
